# Grepobot
## Description
Welcome to Grepobot, a project I created to practice using Selenium while enhancing the gaming experience for [Grepolis](https://en.grepolis.com/) players. This bot has been developed to automate repetitive tasks such as resource collection and building construction, freeing up time for players to focus more on strategy.

Grepobot offers advanced customization features, allowing users to adjust settings according to their gaming preferences. Explore the potential of Grepobot and refer to the user guide for seamless integration of this solution into your Grepolis adventure.

**Important Note:** It is crucial to emphasize that the use of this bot may violate Grepolis' terms of service. It is strongly discouraged to use it for cheating or breaking the game rules. The bot's author takes no responsibility for any account sanctions resulting from its use. Use Grepobot responsibly and ethically.
